<h3> Implementation of different interesting algorithms (Spring 2013) </h3>

Algorithms covered:
<ul>
  <li>ADFGX Chiper</li>
  <li>Counting Sort</li>
  <li>Horspool (searching for substrings)</li>
  <li>Huffman Coding</li>
  <li>Huffman Adaptive Coding</li>
  <li>Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) (searching for substrings)</li>
  <li>Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) Compression</li>
  <li>Plaifair Chiper</li>
  <li>Radix Sort</li>
  <li>Hierarchical clustering with different distance metrics</li>
</ul>

All algorithms are implemented in C++ and then .DLL is created. Interface in C# uses algorithms from those .DLL to answer users needs.
Programs are developed in Slovenian language as part of Aplications of Computer Algorithms class in spring 2013.
